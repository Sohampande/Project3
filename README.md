This project analyzes historical stock data for four major companies—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM)—between 2020 and 2025. Using the yfinance library, the dataset is fetched and evaluated for null values, confirming clean and reliable inputs. The notebook includes visual analysis of closing prices, trends across the COVID-19 period, and comparative behavior post-2023. Key insights include Tesla’s high volatility and the relative stability of Microsoft and Apple. Data visualizations are created using Matplotlib with a dark grid aesthetic for clarity. This project demonstrates the use of time-series financial data, data cleaning, and basic descriptive analytics to extract meaningful insights from stock market performance. Ideal for those exploring financial data visualization using Python, Pandas, and yFinance.
